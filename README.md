# http4ts
**Server as a Function HTTP toolkit for TypeScript**

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/http4ts/http4ts/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/http4ts/http4ts/actions)

http4ts is a minimal HTTP library for JavaScript environments ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Deno](https://Deno.land/) etc.) implementing the pattern of server as a function. In http4ts, a server is just a function with the following signature:
``` ts
type HttpHandler = (req: HttpRequest) => HttpResponse | Promise<HttpResponse>;
```
A simple server application can be found in the [examples directory](https://github.com/http4ts/http4ts/tree/master/src/examples).

## Philosophy

http4ts aims to obey the following rules as its base architectural mindset:
* **Server as a Function**: This library is based on the Twitter paper [Your Server as a Function](https://monkey.org/~marius/funsrv.pdf) and inspired by the fantastic [http4k](https://github.com/http4k/http4k/) library. An HTTP server application is a composition of two main types:
    * `HttpHandler`: defines the functions that handle requests.
    * `HttpFilter`: a higher-order function that accepts an `HttpHandler` and returns an `HttpHandler`. It should be used to add request/response pre-/post-processing.
* **Runtime Independence**: While the library has bindings to be used with a Node.js runtime, the core library does not have any dependency on the Node.js environment. It should be possible to use it for both Node.js and Deno.
* **Symmetric**: Similar to http4k, this library supports symmetric interfaces for the HTTP client and HTTP server. It is possible to reuse the same `HttpHandler` interface and all the filters on both server- and client-side. There is an `HttpClient` functionality available in the library which follows the [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) interface and is independent of any runtime.
* **Type Safety**: http4ts is built using the maximum type safety power of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and, in order to use its maximum power, you should do the same.
* **Immutability**: Similar to http4k, all entities in the library are immutable unless, naturally, it is not possible.
* **Testability**: Since the basic building blocks of this library are functions and the main entities are abstracted from the environment, it is extremely simple to write tests for the code built by http4ts.
* **Minimal**: The request and response contain only the necessary information to represent the HTTP message. Extra information such as session and cookies are not included because they don't belong to the HTTP protocol.

## Binding to Node.js

### HTTP Server

In order to use this library in Node.js, you have to bind the `HttpHandler` to the Node.js HTTP server. http4ts supplies a [`toNodeRequestListener`](https://github.com/http4ts/http4ts/blob/master/src/node/server.ts) to bind an `HttpHandler` to the Node.js server.

``` ts
import * as http from "http";

import { HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpStatus } from "../http";
import { toNodeRequestListener } from "../node/server";

async function handler(req: HttpRequest): Promise<HttpResponse> {
  return {
    body: req.url,
    headers: {},
    status: HttpStatus.OK
  };
}

const server = http.createServer(toNodeRequestListener(handler));

const hostname = "127.0.0.1";
const port = 3000;

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

It is possible to bind http4ts to any Node.js server framework at any level. For example, you can bind it to expressjs after or before routing logic. This helps to gradually adapt your existing code to this architecture.
